Gershan Lombard is qualified Conscious Connected Breathwork Practitioner. He also uses Sound as a modality for healing, having spent many years travelling the world performing. Having deepened on his Shamanic journey he realized that he needed to take Music further and deepen into the expression. The Sound of the Indigenous Bow calls on a deep Ancestral knowing that is available to us all.
