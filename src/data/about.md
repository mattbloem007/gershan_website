Gershan was born in Ceres and grew up in Citrusdal, with his Ancestry firmly rooted in Khoi and San lineages.

His mix of Modern and Ancient sound waves produces enchanting rhythmic forms that share stories and messages from one of the oldest tribes on Earth.

His offerings are channelings of ancient messages unearthed in modern times to inspire his audience to remember their own true nature.

He uses Sound as a modality for Healing, having spent many years travelling the world performing. Deepening into his Shamanic journey he realized that he needed to take Music further and share it in Ceremonial settings.

The Sound of the Indigenous Bow calls on a deep Ancestral knowing that is available to us all.

Gershan Lombard is a qualified Conscious Connected Breathwork Practitioner. Feeling the need to explore other modalities, the breath found him.

Studying and completing a Teacher Training Course under the Tutelage of Mike O'Meara (Celtic Breathwork).

Immersing himself into the breath and the benefits of it has been truly transformational. The benefits of breathing well extend across all aspects of our living experience.

On a Physical level of experience, the breath is the primary source of energy, detoxification, and connection to Life.

Mentally and Emotionally, enhanced breathing tends to shift our body/mind state towards the positive end of the spectrum of experiences ie. Blissful, Euphoric States.

Spiritually the practice of breathwork can also help us to deepen our own connection to The Divine Source/Creator.



Yours in Service.
