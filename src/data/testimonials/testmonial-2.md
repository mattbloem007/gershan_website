These 5 sessions with Gershan were my first immersive and consistent experience with a breathwork modality since introducing yoga pranayama (mostly with asana) a decade ago. 

I can feel how my breathing apparatus (the deep tissues and physical capacity of breath) have opened up significantly over these sessions, and unblocked the many rounds of  flu-connected 'shortness of breath' that I've had over the last 5 years. The awareness of some of the sources of this tendency of limitation in my breath is being nurtured, with the loving guidance of Gershan. I can feel the energetic ease and trust that the breathwork has made room for in my body/being.

With Gershan, he has a gift for saying the right cue or observation at the right time, and in a grounded way that allowed me to take it in and apply it in the practice. The way he delivers these is gracious, gentle and strong. I noticed how open I was to the uptake of his guidance at different stages and states of the breathwork.

His ritual with the breathwork is simple, powerful and so supportive. I love the rootedness of his allies and the sincere openness of calling in mine. The deep feeling of support from all the realms and beings who gather in the session to be a part of the healing and awakening. 

I am so grateful for what has been made possible in my physical and energy body over the past 3 months. I am deeply grateful for the quality of the space and support system that was held by Gershan, and the medicine of the breath, for moving through some challenging and deepening times. 

I am very keen to keep a practice going with Gershan and to keep a space open for this breathwork to continue it's work in my life.
