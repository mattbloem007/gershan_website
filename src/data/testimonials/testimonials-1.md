I had five 1:1 sessions with Gershan, each of which were incredibly powerful and unique, all of

which were impeccably held. My experience of Gershan as a breathwork facilitator has been so

potent and positive. What a gift to witness someone doing the thing they were always meant to

do. The container was a beautiful merging of ceremony, sound, body, heart, ancestors, and

care. This series helped me find release, move through resistance and fear, create shifts and

deepen into a greater sense of alignment, connection and empowerment. Gershan is highly

attuned, compassionate and sincere, and knows what he is doing. He offers a truly special

space that honors the sacredness of life, breath, and all the waves of bliss, grief, tenderness,

intensity and clarity. He manages to strike a balance between guidance and gentleness,

offering both encouragement and space. I felt incredibly supported, safe and respected. I want

to send my whole family for sessions.
