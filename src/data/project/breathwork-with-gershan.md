Breath, in this case, Conscious Connected Breathwork has been a revelation in my life. 

So much of our breathing happens unconsciously, and using this incredible tool to make the Subconscious, Conscious will do wonders for you as well. The breath tells us so much about our lives and where 'the body keeps score'. 

There is a common misconception being perpetuated that Breathwork is used to heal us, and whilst this is true and does happen, to say this is to only begin to scratch the surface of what is actually possible. 

Breathwork can be used, simply as a meditation, as a means to remain focused and centered in your body. To not be so reactive, when we are triggered (if one is to be triggered at all). With every conscious breath, we present ourselves with Life itself. It is an opportunity for us to find ourselves naturally alive amidst a constantly changing world.

It is important to note that in doing breathwork with me (or anyone) it is your breath that will ultimately be your own greatest teacher.

It is also important to note, that when you choose to do this journey with me, it is best if we don't simply have a once-off session but rather a minimum of 3 sessions, just so that we are able to chronicle your breath journey sufficiently. 1 session simply is not enough to make enough of an assessment.

Yours in Service

Gershan
