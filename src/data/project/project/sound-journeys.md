This journey with sound has been through many permutations and I'm sure it will continue to evolve.

Using the technology of the Indigenous Bow, the monotone sound is designed to induce a trance-like state in the listener. The polyphonic harmonies draw on the tribes from times gone by. This journey is probably best described  as a contemporary take on the Trance Dance done around the fire by the bushmen. 

The fact that is only sound and tones means that no words can be imprinted into the journey, it is all yours. The sound takes you through time and space and your own subconscious. The ultimate intention is to be able to embody these sounds and get you moving and grooving into ecstatic bliss.
