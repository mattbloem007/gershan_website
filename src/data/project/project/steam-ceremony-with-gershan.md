The steam ceremony serves as a beautiful purification process. If you are planning on embarking on any other medicine, be it psychedelic journey or any other process it serves as a beautiful 'path-opener' and ally.

It is an experience akin to being back in the womb where one really gets to be with the heat and the sweat and the darkness.

The steam also involves different herbs that serves a different purpose.  It could be household names like 

**Lavender : Aches and Pains, Respiratory Problems, Lowering Blood Pressure**

**Rosemary: Improved concentration/memory, Circulatory Problems + Headaches , Anti-Fungal, Inflammation.**

**Imphepho: Fortifying the body's natural defenses, Stress alleviation, Rich in antioxidants**

**David's Root: Mental Clarity, Protection**

These aforementioned herbs are but a few of the options I use. 

 The variety used is based on an intuitive process depending on the individual need of the client.

Yours in Service

Gershan
