One of the things I hear most often is how different a group session is to a 1-on-1 breath session. Not enough time spent debriefing, not enough return breathers to come and delve into the breathwork process, and more.

Well for this reason I am piecing together a recurring group container, a 6-week intensive course of Breathwork, activities and check-in sessions for all the participants.

Once the container starts, there are no more people added to the container, and we just journey with the core group of individuals, exploring the richness of the journey together, holding each other accountable and most importantly supporting one another. 

Get in touch to join the container and reserve your space.
